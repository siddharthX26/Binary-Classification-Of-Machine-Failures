# Binary-Classification-Of-Machine-Failures

Hi Learners, Today we shall explore the binary classification type of problem.
This will be fairly light-weight dataset that is synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.

We follow our ideal ML Approach.

EDA -> Data Cleaning -> Data Pre-Processing -> Data Visualizaion -> Data Modelling - Model Evaluation.

Something new that we use in this is the Undersampling Technique, which is used when one class of our target is heavily biased.
We Use various type of Models like Logistic, SVC, XGBoost and also CatBoost Classifier.

Your can find the evaluation metrics for each one of them below the trained model.
Happy Learning!
